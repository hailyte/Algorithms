A matrix multiplication program for part of an Algorithms course project. Implements both the standard brute force algorithm and Strassen's algorithm. Unit tests not included since they were provided by the instructor. *Note: completed October 11, 2015.*

`Matrix.java` creates n x n matrices as 2D arrays and provides methods for multiplication and comparison.

`MatrixMultiplicationTest.java` contains a main method test.

`report.txt` contains an analysis of the algorithms and their performances.
