A matrix multiplication program that implements both the standard brute force algorithm and Strassen's algorithm. Unit tests were provided by the instructor and thus are not included here. *Note: completed October 11, 2015.*

`Matrix.java` creates n x n matrices as 2D arrays and provides methods for multiplication and comparison.

`MatrixMultiplicationTest.java` contains a main method test.

`report.txt` contains an analysis of the algorithms and their performances.
