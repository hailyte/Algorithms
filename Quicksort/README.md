A program that implements two versions of quicksort using different pivots: the last element and the median (as determined by the median of medians strategy). Unit tests were provided by the instructor and thus are not included here. *Note: completed October 18, 2015.*

`Quicksort.java` contains methods for quicksort, selection, getting and resetting the number of comparisons made so far, and generating random arrays.

`QuicksortTester.java` contains a main method test.

`report.md` contains an analysis on using quicksort with different pivots, including a table that compares execution time and number of comparisons when sorting different size arrays.
